# 13 — Build status (living document)

Reconciled **2026-09-13** after release **v2.9.0** at `7d939c7`.
Core/CLI **2.9.0**, signing **0.2.13** and batch **0.8.8** are published and
verified through a clean npm installation. Format **2.0** and Protocol
**2.12.0** version independently. See [release evidence](../reviews/2026-09-12-release-2.9.0.md),
[VERSIONS.md](../../VERSIONS.md) and [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md).

## Built and released

- Reader/editor/calc/agent-host foundations; Format 2.0 metadata, provenance,
  scoped edits, deterministic asset packs, class-aware readiness and validation.
- Calendar cash flows, xirr/xnpv, typed capital stacks, lease-up schedules,
  mixed-use component aggregation and LP-IRR waterfalls.
- Signed blocks/modules, capability tokens, receipts and conformance profiles;
  JSON/XML/CSV interchange, optional HTTP/MCP profiles, document composition,
  market data, portfolio relationships and batch corpus fact tables.
- RFCs 0040/0041 in 2.7.0: signed block roles and explicit period identities.
- RFCs 0042–0044 in 2.8.0: fixed stated period refinement inputs, contextual
  workbook binding APIs, validated CLI calculation context, and explicit
  lease-up cash-flow projection with semantic source evidence.

## Implemented supporting tools

Web editor/viewer, docs site and VS Code extension are implemented. Standalone
Excel **0.9.1**, report **0.8.13**, and hospitality/data-center module packages **0.1.1**
remain unpublished. Core's RFC 0043 binding API is published; the full Excel
exporter remains available from source. Native Excel 16.0 build 20326 passed
14 scenarios / 48 cell checks. Reverse import of additional inputs refuses.

## Verification

Release preparation passed clean npm ci, build, **1,990 workspace tests**,
test typechecking, **457 default + 76 declarative conformance checks**,
**34 JSON schemas**, lint, lockfile/package/version/index/release checks and
documentation build. Separate tarball and registry installations verified
core/browser assembly and projection, synthetic pinned metrics, explicit zeros, CLI success/refusal,
signing exports and batch indexing. Source documents remained unchanged.

PCG64 independently matches NumPy 1.26.4's compiled implementation over
11 seeds, 11,264 raw draws and 176 doubles. See the [record](../reviews/2026-09-12-pcg64-reference.md).
No financial formula, precision boundary or calculation digest changed in the
release repin. The three receipt edits changed engine-version labels only.

## Property cash-flow assembly released in 2.9.0

RFC 0045 adds `assemblePropertyCashFlows` and `uwmd assemble-property` under
Protocol 2.12.0. It assembles explicitly covered unlevered/pre-tax cash in one
declared currency, with real purchase anchoring, reserve assertions and source
evidence. The owner selected a synthetic test ledger; real-deal review remains
separate. See the [workflow](../PROPERTY_CASH_FLOW_WORKFLOW.md).
This API and CLI are published in 2.9.0.

## Unreleased development after 2.9.0

The source CLI adds `verify-cash-flows` for selected stated-metric comparisons,
with explicit no-claim results, input guards and read-only behavior. This reuses
the published metric engine without changing the protocol or financial math.
Private archived-deal comparisons informed the workflow; no private ledgers or
property identifiers are included in public fixtures. Complete real-deal
assembly still needs explicit expense/reserve coverage and payment timing.

RFC 0046 is implemented on the development branch but unreleased: optional
document-level `currency_code` makes display denomination explicit without
changing numeric storage, calculation, or locale separators. `CUR-01` refuses
malformed identity; per-value/multi-currency representation and FX remain
deferred.

RFC 0047 is implemented on the development branch but unreleased:
`inspectPropertyCashFlowInputs` and `inspect-property-cash-flows` inventory the
source shape needed for RFC 0045 authoring without classifying rows or inferring
expense, reserve, or payment timing.

Data-center conformance is structurally complete as a reference module: six
dedicated runtime scenarios, 26 module tests, 11 calculations, seven
validations, and explicit fallback/degraded behavior. The Mesa Gateway fixture
is synthetic and the module package remains unpublished, so adopter validation
is still open. The built-in library covers nine calculation packs; mixed-use is
composition rather than a standalone pack.

RFC 0048 and RFC 0049 are draft adoption RFCs. RFC 0048 scopes standalone
document/package examples; RFC 0049 scopes an optional PostgreSQL/JSONB lake
adapter outside the protocol and core dependencies.

RFC 0050 is implemented on `codex/work` but unreleased: split preferred-equity
coupons use one tranche with `cash_rate` for coverage, `accrued_rate` excluded
from coverage, and full `rate` for weighted cost. Debt PIK toggles and accrued
compounding remain deferred. Release still requires the RFC, the
format/schema/protocol triad, and conformance fixtures to be accepted together.

RFC 0051 is implemented on `codex/work` but unreleased: `hurdle_mode: "any"`
enables dual-hurdle tiers to end as soon as either `until_lp_em` or
`until_lp_irr` is met (smaller capacity), while default `hurdle_mode: "both"`
preserves existing behavior (larger capacity). `WF-01` rejects `hurdle_mode`
when both hurdles are not present.

## Remaining work

- Validate RFC 0045 against a real deal. Levered/tax, post-sale and reserve-rollforward
  extensions remain separate contracts; declared completeness is not verified
  economics.
- Speculative leasing needs explicit renewal/vacancy, rent reset and TI/LC timing
  rules with an adopter example. Array iteration alone does not supply them.
- Reverse import, structural workbook edits, period defaults and cash-flow
  metric Excel export remain separate extensions.
- Waterfall extensions, per-value currency identity and stochastic VOI need
  bounded contracts. Retrieval and standalone optional-package publication remain
  demand-gated. DOCX remains scoped out by the owner.
